# SESMA: Script enabled starship management application

*Project status: Just started..*

This is a learning / demo application, experimenting with and showing off 

* how to embed the Dynamic Language Runtime in a .NET application 
* thereby making it scriptable.

It is also my first attempt at using some new .NET 4 features, like 

* DynamicObject
* IObservable&lt;T&gt; and IObserver&lt;T&gt;
* code contracts

Finally, during this project I'll

* use [TDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) where it makes sense, but I will not spend much effort on maintaining a high code coverage
* try to adhere better to the [Single Responsibility Principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) than I usually do.
