# SESMA: Script enabled starship management application

This is a learning / demo application, experimenting with and showing off 

* how to embed the Dynamic Language Runtime in a .NET application 
* thereby making it scriptable.

It is also my first try at using some new .NET 4 features, like 

* DynamicObject
* IObservable<T> / IObserver<T>
* code contracts

*Project status: Just started..*
