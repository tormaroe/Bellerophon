# SESMA: Script enabled starship management application

This is a learning / demo application, experimenting with and showing off how to embed the Dynamic Language Runtime in a .NET application and thereby making it scriptable.

It is also my first try at using some new .NET 4 features like DynamicObject, IObservable<T> / IObserver<T>, code contracts etc.

Status: Just started..
